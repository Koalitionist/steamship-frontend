## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.

## Generating Docs

Visit the [python-client repo](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client), navigate to the `docs` folder, and run `make markdown`.

**Note**: The make command assumes that this repository is located in the same directory as the `python-client` repo.
