# Create your Agent

You can build and deploy your Agent without a programming environment on your computer. You just need:

1. **A web browser** with internet access
2. **A GitHub account** - for a cloud programming environment
3. **A Steamship account** - for AI hosting in the cloud

To build an Agent on your local machine, first you'll need to make sure your machine has the right dependencies:

1. Python 3.8
2. git
3. An IDE of your preference

Then, just:

1. Follow the link above.
2. Copy the GitHub repository link.
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
    git clone <url>
   ```
4. Change directories into your new project.
5. Set up a Python Virtual environment with the required dependencies:

   In MacOS or Linux:
      ```bash
        python3.8 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

   In Windows:
      ```bash
        python38 -m venv .venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        python38 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

6. Once your Python dependencies are installed, run:
   ```bash
    ship login
   ```

That's it! You should be ready to begin.
