# Personality Ideas

Several schools have reached out about using this guidebook as curriculum, so we're trying to drop in some classroom-style activities here and there.

Here's one to help you stretch your idea about what "Personality" can mean for an agent.

{% callout title="Activity: What's an Agent 'Personality'?" %}

Take an hour and see how far you can push the idea of personality hacking. It's probably farther than you think.

Can you give your agent..

**A Helpful Personality?**

- Directed at explaining things to a novice?
- Directed at pumping someone up before a big event?
- Directed at helping someone think through a problem?

**A Manipulative Personality?**

- That always frames things from a particular political viewpoint?
- That tries to subtly suggest any problems you have can be solved with a shopping spree?

**A one-track-mind?**

- That only talks about cheeseburgers, trying to bring any other conversation back to them?

**A COMPUTER mind?**

- That responds to your English language questions with JSON or CSV?
- That responds to your English language questions with a plausible database query that might answer them?

**A translator?**

- That responds to every question in French?
