# Add a Personality

Your Agent's personality is drive primarily by its `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
This prompt acts as a preamble to the text completions that your agent does to contribute to a chat. 

At the top of most [example agents](https://github.com/steamship-core/multimodal-agent-starter/tree/main/src/example_agents), you'll find a variable named `SYSTEM_PROMPT` that you can modify to experiment with this personality.
