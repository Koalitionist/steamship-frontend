You can use the [`GoogleImageSearchTool`](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/tools/image_generation/google_image_search.py) to generate and return Google Image Search results from your agent.

## Building a ReACT Agent with `GoogleImageSearchTool`

Just provide the [`GoogleImageSearchTool`](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/tools/image_generation/google_image_search.py) to your [`FunctionsBasedAgent`](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/functional/functions_based.py) to use it.

```python
from steamship.agents.tools.image_generation import GoogleImageSearchTool

self._agent = FunctionsBasedAgent(
    tools=[
        GoogleImageSearchTool(),
    ],
    llm=OpenAI(self.client),
)
```

By default, this will cause the ReACT agent to generate an image when you request a picture of something.
If will do so by using Google's managed Google Image Search plugin.

If you want to change or constrain the circumstances when this tool is used, you can set the `ai_description` field during initialization:

```python
DalleTool(
    ai_description=(
        "Used to retrieve an image of a well known object, person, place, or idea. "
        "Only use if the user has asked directly for an image of a well known subject. "
        "The input is a plain text string describing an object, person, place, or idea. "
        "The output is an image of that thing."
    )
)
```

## Full-working examples of `DalleTool`

The following examples can be copy-pasted into your project:

- [GoogleChatbot](https://github.com/steamship-core/multimodal-agent-starter/blob/main/src/example_agents/google_chatbot.py) - Uses Google Image Search and Google Question Answering to generate images and answers from the web.

## Deploying an AgentService with `GoogleImageSearchTool`

To deploy an agent with this tool, just make sure it's properly wrapped in an [`AgentService`](/agent-guidebook/core-concepts/api-py) wrapper and then follow the normal [deployment instructions](/agent-guidebook/getting-started/deploy-your-agent).
You will get a URL that you can visit to create instances of your agent in the cloud and connect to it from the web & chat apps.
