title: Generate Images
description: Give your agent powers like DALL-E, StableDiffusion, and Google Image Search.
---

Steamship agents are multi-modal: they can send and receive text, images, audio, and video.

This chapter shows you how to generate (or locate) and return images from your agents:

- [with DALL-E](/agent-guidebook/generate-images/generate-dalle-images)
- [with Stable Diffusion](/agent-guidebook/generate-images/generate-stable-diffusion-images)
- [with Google Image Search](/agent-guidebook/generate-images/generate-google-search-images)

It also shows how to build new image [Tools](/agent-guidebook/core-concepts/tools) that wrap these tools with your own prompts or logic:

- [Image & Prompt Bundling](/agent-guidebook/generate-images/bundling-prompts)

## What you can build with this chapter

This chapter will let you build:

- An agent that can fetch images from the web for you (with [Google Image Search](/agent-guidebook/generate-images/generate-google-search-images))
- A chatbot that can generate DALL-E or Stable Diffusion images for your friends in a chat room

You can combine these skills with [personalities](/agent-guidebook/personality/add-a-personality) and [moods](/agent-guidebook/personality/add-a-dynamic-mood) to:

- Create characters that can show you their imaginary world
- Create characters whose image generation style is influenced by the mood they're in

You can combine these skills with Steamship's [Key-Value storage](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/utils/kv_store.py) to:

- Create characters that remember where the are, and show you photos from that place
- Create bots that let you and your friends record prompt macros and then use them to generate images
