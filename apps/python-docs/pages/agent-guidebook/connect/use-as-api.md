# Use your agent as an API

Each agent instance provides an HTTP API

Every agent instance automatically provides an HTTP API.

After [deploying](/agent-guidebook/getting-started/deploy-your-agent), just [create an instance from the web](/agent-guidebook/getting-started/share-your-agent).

That will take you to a web page that contains a chat window as well as other management tools for your agent.

To view your agents's API endpoints:

- Select the **Manage** tab at the top right.
- Select the **API** tab at left.
