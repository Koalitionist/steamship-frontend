# Embed your agent on a web site

You can embed your agent on other sites with an IFRAME

Use the [`SteamshipWidgetTransport` Mixin](https://github.com/steamship-core/python-client/blob/main/src/steamship/agents/mixins/transports/steamship_widget.py) to give your agent a web-based widget you can interact with.

**[A full working example is here](https://github.com/steamship-core/multimodal-agent-starter/blob/main/src/example_agents/annoyed_robot.py)**. 
You can copy and paste this agent into your `api.py` file or use it as a reference.

## Adding the `SteamshipWidgetTransport` Mixin

1. Add `SteamshipWidgetTransport` to the static `USED_MIXIN_CLASSES` list in your AgentService
2. Register `SteamshipWidgetTransport` in your AgentService `__init__` with
   ```python
   self.add_mixin(SteamshipWidgetTransport(self.client, self, self.agent))
   ```

## Using the Web Widget

After [deploying](/agent-guidebook/getting-started/deploy-your-agent), just [create an instance from the web](/agent-guidebook/getting-started/share-your-agent).

That will take you to a web page that contains a chat window as well as other management tools for your agent.

## Embedding the Web Widget

At the top-right, you will find an **Embed** widget with instructions for placing this chat window on other web pages.
