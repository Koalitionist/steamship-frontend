# Agent Guidebook

This guidebook will walk you through **building and deploying** your own AI Agent.

"**Agents**" are the emerging programming model for AI apps: from question answering, to AI management coaching, to image generation services, to AI friends.

The chapters in this guidebook will show you how to:

- [**🤖 Add a custom personality**](/agent-guidebook/personality/add-a-personality) and moods using Prompt Engineering
- [**🏞️ Generate images**](/agent-guidebook/generate-images) with Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, or Google Image Search
- [**🔈 Use voice**](/agent-guidebook/generate-speech) to interact with you
- [**📲 Connect to apps**](/agent-guidebook/connect/use-on-the-web) like Telegram or embed on your website

[//]: # '- [**💁‍️️ Answer questions**](/agent-guidebook/question-answering) about PDFs, YouTube videos, or private datasets'

Plus it's all open-source Python: you can change anything you see in this guidebook.
